# CPU-Control-Unit-Model

This repository contains the implementation of a complete CPU design as part of a Computer Architecture course project. The project includes the design and integration of a control unit and a data path along with reset circuit, along with other essential components of the CPU.

Please refer to the report on the main directory for more details about how the components were developed using VHDL and integrated into a CPU.
